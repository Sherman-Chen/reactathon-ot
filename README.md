# reactathon-ot

Our submission for Reactathon 2017 Hackathon. We placed 2nd for the Open Table API Challenge and top 7 overall.

Our project was an accessibility focused integration built on top of OpenTable's API. It allowed users to interact with OpenTable purely via speech commands, i.e finding and reserving a restaurant time, and also allowed for audio playback to the user. In addition we leveraged Serverless and Cloud Functions to send SMS text alert confirming the reservations.

Unfortunately the API exposed was a one-time deal for event purposes and the access tokens are no longer valid, however you can still
see a demo of our App in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-QZrLoA2aQ) at the 50:24 mark!
